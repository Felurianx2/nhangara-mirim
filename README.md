# **Project for the Hedera Hackathon**  
**Track:** Education, Regenerative Culture, and Blockchain  
**Technology:** Hedera Hashgraph (HTS, Smart Contracts)

## Overview

**Nhangara Mirim** is an educational and gamified mobile app that turns children into guardians of the Earth through eco-entrepreneurship, ancestral knowledge, and Web3 technology. We merge Brazilian folklore, NFTs, and circular economy models to create a platform where learning meets long-term impact.

Our MVP focuses on the **Atlantic Forest biome**, featuring a functional mini-game, customizable avatars, real integration with the **Hedera testnet**, and a royalty system that perpetually rewards indigenous and Afro-Brazilian artists.

## The Problem We Solve

- Passive, alienating education for children
- Cultural exploitation and disconnection from environmental responsibility
- Lack of fair compensation and digital sovereignty for traditional artists

## Our Solution

### MVP — Full Value Cycle

1. **Children play** and complete ecological missions across Brazilian biomes  
2. **They earn NFTs** (e.g., “Birthspring Bio-Amulet”)  
3. **The NFT is minted on Hedera testnet**  
4. **NFTs can be resold in a simulated marketplace**  
5. **Royalties are automatically sent back to the original creator**
